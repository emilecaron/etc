config
======

Config files for my desktop environment.
For the base config, see github/crichon.

Modifications
=============
- A reworked config files to fit my own laptop
- A python script to fetch news from a rss feed
- A python daemon system for efficient energy management when starting a script every second


Even if some easiest ways can be used to integrate an rss feed to conky, this quick project was as much for the result as it is for the challenge.
